# Animal Shelter Management System

## Overview
This project is a user-friendly, web-based application designed to help animal shelters manage and organize their animal data. Whether you're an animal shelter staff member or a potential adopter, this app offers a seamless experience for viewing and filtering animals based on key criteria such as adoption status, animal type, and more.

The application’s intuitive interface allows shelter workers to easily track the status of animals—whether they are up for adoption, in need of medical care, or have already been adopted. Users can filter animals by type (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird) or by adoption status, ensuring that potential adopters can find the perfect pet for them based on their preferences. The system provides shelter staff with the tools to stay organized and efficient while ensuring that all animals are properly tracked and accounted for.

Whether you're looking for a playful puppy, a calm cat, or simply want to see what animals are currently available for adoption, this app provides an easy way to manage and explore all the lovable creatures waiting for a forever home.
